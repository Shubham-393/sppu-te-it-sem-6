Quick Guide: File Transfer Between Two VMs Using `scp`

✅ Step 1: Configure VirtualBox for NAT Network
1. Open VirtualBox → File > Host Network Manager → Create NAT Network (e.g., NATNetwork).
2. Enable DHCP.
3. For both VMs:
   - Go to Settings > Network
   - Attach Adapter 1 to: NAT Network
   - Select the NAT Network you created.

✅ Step 2: Boot Both VMs & Install `net-tools`
sudo apt update
sudo apt install net-tools

✅ Step 3: Check IP Address of Both VMs
ifconfig
(Note the IP under `enp0s3` or similar)

✅ Step 4: Create a Simple File to Transfer
echo "Hello from VM1!" > sample.txt

✅ Step 5: Allow SSH Access (if needed)
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh

✅ Step 6: Set Permissions (Optional)
chmod 644 sample.txt

✅ Step 7: Use `scp` to Transfer File
scp sample.txt user@<VM2-IP>:/home/user/
(Replace `user` and `<VM2-IP>` appropriately)

✅ Step 8: Verify on VM2
cat sample.txt
(Output: Hello from VM1!)
